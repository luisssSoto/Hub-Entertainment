## Instructions 
Running this app is pretty fast, only follow the steps below:
- [ ] Use `git clone` wherever you want the proyect will be
- [ ] Open the login.html file in whatever search you want (Google Chrome, Firefox etc)
- [ ] Don't worry about the username and passwords, just added any email with the specified format and a password with three letters and four numbers (in that order)
- [ ] Click on "Send" button
- [ ] Enjoy it

## How I did it ...
1. I organize all the work in Trello: https://trello.com/b/nFxwDp9U/hub-entertainment
2. I did a mockup in figma: https://www.figma.com/design/NSQFoxWQjEVp1BBeCn6n6c/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=JXQyVJuvXVWb6Q9S-0 
3. I started with HTML to structure each page
4. Once I finished with one .html file I used to add a design with CSS
5. At the end I added JavaScript to get an interactive and functional web site  

## Well-known problems
Security 'cause of the login is not safety at all

## Sprint Review

| What was well?       | What could I do diferent | What was not really good?                                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| * I was so organized | * Asking for help        | * I didn't use any framework to be more efficient with CSS  |
| * I worked hard      |                          |                                                              |
